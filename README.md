# adventure-console

The Adventure Console is a portal to distant worlds, epic quests, and ancient
mysteries. Step into the shoes of a hero as you explore vibrant locales and
battle vicious foes, _all in thrilling plaintext!_

**The Adventure Console: _It's beyond live!_**

...But more concretely, the Adventure Console is an open-source browser interface
designed for text adventures. It ~is~ _will be_ integrated with an engine implementing
the Pathfinder system, allowing you to easily incorporate pencil-and-paper role-playing
elements into your stories.
