The Adventure Console is a portal to distant worlds, epic quests, and ancient
mysteries. Step into the shoes of a hero as you explore vibrant locales and
battle vicious foes, _all in thrilling plaintext!_. The Adventure Console:
_It's beyond live!_

But more concretely...

The Adventure Console is a browser interface designed for text adventures.
It ~is~ _will be_ integrated with an engine implementing the Pathfinder system,
allowing you to easily incorporate pencil-and-paper role-playing elements into
your stories.
